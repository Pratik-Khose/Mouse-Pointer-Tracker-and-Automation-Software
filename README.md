# Mouse-Pointer-Tracker-and-Automation-Software

**Mouse Tracker with Snapshots** is a Python-based GUI application that tracks the live coordinates of your mouse pointer and allows you to take "snapshots" of your mouse position with a timestamp. You can save these snapshots to a text file and later use it to automate the clicks and steps to ease your life and minimize human efforts by automating the same age old daily tasks being done in one single click.

## Features

- Live tracking of mouse coordinates.
- Take snapshots by pressing the `s` key three times.
- Save snapshots to a `.txt` file.
- Fixed window size and themed UI similar to the Microsoft Snipping Tool.
